  <h3>What is mac & Cheese?</h3>
  <bl>
 <p>Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese
 in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese
 in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked
 macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly
cheddar cheese.
<bl>
 The traditional macaroni and cheese is
 a casserole baked in the oven; however
, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top
 of the stove or using a packaged mix.
 The cheese is often first incorporated into
 a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce,
 which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
